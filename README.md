# SphereTracer
This was just a fairly small project I made because I wanted to have a sphere-tracer and wanted to render fractals.
I learned most of the theory about sphere-tracing from [scratchapixel](scratchapixel.com/lessons/advanced-rendering/rendering-distance-fields) and I implemented the logic in an OpenGL compute shader.

Some screenshots from the renderer:
